This plugn has been created using the [Cheshire cat AI plugin template](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/plugin-template) and inspired by the [Mycroft-Cat plugin](https://github.com/pazoff/Mycroft-Cat). 

It is useful if you want to play the cat answers with custom voices from Eleven Lab API.

## Usage

1. You need [Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview) API access and a API Key.
2. You need a voice ID (use List voices API and the right filter to find the ID). 
3. Install the Voices plugin and enable it.
4. Configure the Voices plugin settings.

Now any chat with the cat will also have an auto played audio message.
